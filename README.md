# HACK-THE-BOX

So, umm apparently, I'm into _ethical hacking_ and shit, and I got to know about this website called **Hackthebox** which has servers are ready to be hacked, you just have to turn on them, no questions asked. They all have different vulnerabilities and we need to exploit them in order to gain access into the machine and extract the **root** flag (A text file containing just a bunch of characters which can only be accessed after the attacker has made his/her way into the target machine).
And I was making notes side-by-side, because apparently, note-making helps you go a long way in this ethical hacking stuff.
So, I thought I should make a repository and push these notes here, might help anyone in need.. 

GG, Hope this helps.
